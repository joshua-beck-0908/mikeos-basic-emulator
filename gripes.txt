Current language issues:
 * No IFÂ blocks.
    * Would need an ENDIF command.
    * Would need IF/ELSE modifications.
 * Types accepted are inconsistant.
    * A secondary layer like we have here for 'get_x' would help.
    * TachyonOS already did this? Can we use that?
 * No way to do bracketed sums/strings.
    * Would need to implement recursion in the parser.
    * Should the same brackets be used for both?
